# Mill Conversion, Macclesfield

Our client, Silkdale Homes, purchased a two storey mill with planning permission for subdivision into 5 no 2 bedroom terraced houses, including rear extension to each house to provide bathrooms and wc/cloaks to comply with disabled access legislation.

We managed to squeeze a second floor into each property, which allowed a third bedroom â€“ it also allowed us to make a feature of the original roof trusses within the extra bedroom.

Our client intended to rent the properties to young professionals in the area, so wanted a contemporary feel, which we achieved with the installation of purpose made powder coated aluminium windows and timber floors throughout.
